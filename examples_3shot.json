A scheduled thoracoabdominopelvic CT was performed after intravenous contrast administration, with MPR reconstructions provided. In the chest, mild right gynecomastia is noted. Multiple supradiaphragmatic adenopathies are visualized, including bilateral axillary adenopathies (larger on the right side), ipsilateral diaphragmatic adenopathies, and adenopathies in all mediastinal compartments. Some are notable for their size, but the most significant feature is their number. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion is associated with partial compressive atelectasis of both lower lobes. A laminar pericardial effusion is present. Bilateral infiltrates are identified, predominantly in the upper lobes, with peribronchovascular distribution, ground-glass component, and interstitial reticular pattern, as well as isolated subpleural micronodules in the left upper lobe. Findings are nonspecific, and an infectious origin is most likely. In the abdominopelvic extension of the study, the liver contours are slightly lobulated, with no volume redistribution, homogeneous density, and no evidence of focal lesions. Mild diffuse steatosis is present. The splenoportal mesenteric axis is patent. The gallbladder is contracted, as in the previous ultrasound, likely sclerotic and atrophic, with a hyperdense mold inside related to biliary sludge or lithiasis. The biliary tract is not dilated. Homogeneous splenomegaly with a major axis of 15.1 cm is noted. The pancreas and right adrenal gland show no significant pathological findings. Hyperplasia of the left adrenal gland is present. Kidneys show bilateral simple cortical cysts, with no evidence of solid masses, lithiasis, or excretory tract ectasia. Multiple mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and bilateral inguinal adenopathies are present, which, like the supradiaphragmatic ones, are notable for their number and some for their size. Mild multicompartmental ascites of uncertain origin is noted. An umbilical hernia with fatty content is present, with no signs of complication. Isolated uncomplicated diverticula are seen in the sigmoid colon. Partially calcified aortoiliac atheromatosis is present. No suspicious bone lesions are noted. Degenerative bone changes in the axial skeleton and an image suggestive of a hemangioma on the posterior aspect of the left iliac blade are observed. Summary: Polyserositis of uncertain origin, moderate bilateral pleural effusion, and mild pericardial effusion and multicompartmental ascites of uncertain origin. Cytological and microbiological studies of pleural and ascitic fluid are recommended. Multiple supra- and infradiaphragmatic adenopathies, notable primarily for their number, are associated with splenomegaly. A lymphoproliferative syndrome is the most likely diagnostic option. Adenopathies in the right axillary and ipsilateral inguinal regions are suitable for biopsy. Bilateral interstitial-alveolar pulmonary infiltrates, predominantly in both upper lobes, are of indeterminate origin, with an infectious etiology most likely, though other causes cannot be ruled out.",
    "layman_report": "For three months, the patient has had a general illness with a 20 kg weight loss, anemia, and an abnormality in the right chest area seen on a chest X-ray. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done after injecting a contrast dye, and the results are as follows. In the chest area, there is a mild enlargement of breast tissue in males on the right side. Many lymph nodes above the diaphragm are seen, including those in both armpit areas (larger on the right), on the same side of the diaphragm, and in all areas of the chest middle. Some are noticeable for their size, but the most significant feature is their number. There is a moderate amount of fluid in both sides of the chest, which is causing some collapse of the lower parts of the lungs. A thin layer of fluid is also present around the heart. Infiltrates are seen in both lungs, mainly in the upper parts, around the airways, with a hazy appearance and a pattern that looks like a net, as well as small spots near the outer lung surface on the left upper part. The findings are not specific, and it is most likely due to an infection. In the abdomen and pelvis part of the study, the liver has a slightly uneven shape, with no change in size, uniform density, and no signs of focal lesions. Mild fatty liver disease is present. The spleen and portal vein are normal. The gallbladder is contracted, as seen before in an ultrasound, likely hard and shrunken, with a very dense shape inside related to bile sludge or gallstones. The bile ducts are not dilated. The spleen is enlarged with a major axis of 15.1 cm. The pancreas and right adrenal gland show no significant pathological findings. There is an enlargement of the left adrenal gland. The kidneys show simple cysts in both, with no signs of solid masses, stones, or dilation of the urinary tract. Many lymph nodes are seen in the abdomen, behind the abdomen, and in both groin areas, which, like the ones above the diaphragm, are noticeable for their number and some for their size. A mild amount of fluid is seen in different parts of the abdomen, but the cause is uncertain. An umbilical hernia with fatty content is present, with no signs of complications. Small outpouchings are seen in the sigmoid colon. Partially calcified atherosclerosis is seen in the aorta and iliac arteries. No suspicious bone lesions are noted. Degenerative changes are seen in the spine, and an image is observed that suggests a hemangioma on the back side of the left hip bone. Summary: Inflammation in different parts of the body of uncertain origin, moderate fluid in both chest areas, and mild fluid around the heart and in different parts of the abdomen of uncertain origin. It is recommended to do cytological and microbiological studies of the chest and abdominal fluid. Many lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm, mainly noticeable for their number, are associated with an enlarged spleen. A lymphoproliferative syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Lymph nodes in the right armpit and groin areas are suitable for biopsy. Bilateral lung infiltrates, mainly in both upper parts, are of uncertain origin, most likely due to an infection, but other causes cannot be ruled out."

An ultrasound showed a small amount of fluid around the left lung and a bulge in the right side of his diaphragm. His liver has clear signs of long-term liver disease, with the left part of his liver being much bigger and the right part smaller. The liver's shape is wavy and bumpy, but there are no specific lumps. The main vein in his liver is much bigger than normal, and blood flows in the right direction. The vein that goes to his spleen is also bigger. His spleen is very large, measuring about 16.3 cm in length and has a lot more volume than usual. There is no sign of extra blood vessels forming. There is a small amount of fluid around his liver, but not in other places. His gallbladder has some sludge but the walls are not thickened. The bile ducts inside and outside the liver are not dilated. The pancreas area looks normal. His right kidney is normal, but there is a small cyst in his left kidney. There is no dilation in his urinary tract. His bladder has a little filling but looks normal. In conclusion, he has clear signs of advanced chronic liver disease, high blood pressure in the portal vein, a small amount of fluid around his liver, and a small amount of fluid around the left lung."
