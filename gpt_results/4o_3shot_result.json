No nodular lesions are observed in the visualized lung parenchyma. Splenomegaly and free intra-abdominal fluid are present.",

There is fluid around both lungs, more on the left side, causing part of the left lung to be slightly collapsed. There is also a small area of lung collapse at the bottom of the left lung. No lumps are seen in the lungs. The spleen is enlarged, and there is some fluid in the belly.",

The heart is enlarged, and there are calcium deposits in the heart's blood vessels and the main blood vessel leaving the heart. There is fluid buildup on both sides of the lungs, more on the left, and part of the left lower lung is not fully expanded. A small part of the left lung base is also not fully expanded. No round abnormal growths are seen in the lung tissue. The spleen is enlarged, and there is fluid in the abdominal cavity."
