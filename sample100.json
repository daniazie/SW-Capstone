There are no changes in the pleural thickening, which measures 6.6 mm in maximum thickness, and the fibrotic pleuroparenchymal tract with a nodular component and peripheral ground-glass opacity. Two nodules measuring 4 and 6 mm are located in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, which converge and measure 2.0 x 0.6 cm, previously 2.1 x 0.7 cm on PET-CT from [date]. No other nodules or pulmonary consolidations are identified. There is a severe centrilobular emphysema pattern, predominantly in the upper lobes. Laminar atelectasis is noted in the lingula. No pathological-sized axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes are observed. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The thyroid gland is enlarged with intrathoracic extension, unchanged. The upper abdomen is partially included in the study, with no abnormalities on non-contrast CT. No bone or muscular plane abnormalities are observed. Impression: Mixed pseudonodular opacity in the right upper lobe, which may correspond to lepidic growth adenocarcinoma, with no significant changes in size or appearance since the PET-CT from [date]. Follow-up with CT in 12 months is recommended, with a 3-year follow-up according to the Fleischner Society 2017 guidelines.",
    "layman_report": "We did a special type of chest X-ray called a non-contrast chest CT and compared it to previous chest CT scans and a PET-CT scan from specific dates. The thickening of the lung covering, which is 6.6 mm at its thickest point, and the scar tissue connecting the lung covering to the lung itself with a small nodule and hazy area at the edges, haven't changed. There are two small lumps in the back part of the right upper lung, one measuring 4 mm and the other 6 mm, which together measure 2.0 x 0.6 cm, previously measured as 2.1 x 0.7 cm on the PET-CT scan from a specific date. No other lumps or areas of lung clumping are seen. There is severe damage to the small air sacs in the lungs, mainly in the upper parts. A thin layer of collapsed lung is noted in a part called the lingula. No swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, chest, or lung area are observed. There is no fluid around the lungs or heart. The thyroid gland is enlarged and extends into the chest, unchanged. The upper belly is partially seen in the study, with no abnormalities on the non-contrast CT. No bone or muscle abnormalities are seen. Conclusion: Mixed nodule-like haziness in the right upper lung, which could be a type of lung cancer that grows along the air sacs, with no significant changes in size or appearance since the PET-CT scan from a specific date. It is recommended to follow up with a CT scan in 12 months, and a 3-year follow-up according to the Fleischner Society 2017 guidelines."
